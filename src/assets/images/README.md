# Image Assets

If you use image assets, this is the place to put them. The images task will copy them over to the destination specified in `nucleum.config.js`, and file names will be reved in production builds (if enabled).

If you don't plan using image assets, or are relying on an external services, feel free to delete this folder and set the `images` to false in `nucleum.config.js`.

### Default config

Image files are copied from `./src/assets/images` to `./public/assets/images`.
